# carnet
This is code from the Car-Net project. The project aim was to build a classifier that can identify the make of a car from its image using deep learning. 

Details of the project can be found here: https://altheengineer.github.io/2018-07-03-mypath/

The project uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and the Stanford Cars Dataset. The fastai library was used for rapid machine learning deployment. 

If you're running on a local machine, instructions for installing fastai can be found here: https://github.com/fastai/fastai

Alternatively, if you would like to run the project on Google's Colaboratory environment, there is another notebook that allows you to set up the environment for the fastai library. The notebook is inside this repository and named "colab_fastai_setup.ipynb".

If you would like to use the final model that was trained in this project, you can download from this repository inside the "carsdata/models" directory. Follow the instructions in the main notebook to use the model. 

The Jupyter notebook will allow you to reproduce all of the results from this project.
